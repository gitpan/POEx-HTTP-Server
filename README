=============================

POEx::HTTP::Server is a clean POE implementation of an HTTP server.  It uses
POEx::URI to simplify event specification.  It allows limiting connection
concurrency and implements HTTP 1.1 keep-alive.  It has built in
compatibility with POE::Component::Daemon's prefork server support.

POEx::HTTP::Server also includes a method for easily sending a static file
to the browser, with HEAD and If-Modified-Since support.
